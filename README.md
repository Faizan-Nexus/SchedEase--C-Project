# SchedEase--C-Project
SchedEase is a C++ console app that displays your daily class schedule. Enter a day to view subjects, instructors, timings, and room details. Group-specific schedules (X/Y) and break times are included. With input validation and clear formatting, SchedEase helps you stay organized and manage your routine effortlessly.

The application is highly interactive and ensures accuracy by validating user inputs. For instance, if the schedule involves group-specific classes (Group X or Y), the program prompts the user to enter their group and displays tailored class details accordingly. It also accounts for breaks such as refreshment or Namaz time to give a realistic and complete schedule view.

Key features include:

Dynamic Schedule Management: Displays different schedules for each day, with detailed class information.
Group-Specific Classes: Customizes the schedule based on the selected group (X or Y).
Input Validation: Ensures the user enters valid day names and group identifiers to avoid errors.
Readable and Informative Output: Presents the schedule with clear formatting for a smooth user experience.
Built using the power of C++ structures and functions, this application demonstrates modular programming and reusability by using the displayClassDetails function to present class details efficiently. With ClassTrack, staying organized and on top of your weekly routine has never been easier!
